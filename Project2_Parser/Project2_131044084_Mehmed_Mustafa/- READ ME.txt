INPUTS and rules tested within them
input.txt - deffun, defvar, carpma ve toplama
input2.txt - concat, append, liste, bos liste, toplama
input3.txt - deffun, if then else, set, equal, cikarma, toplama
input4.txt - if, and, or, equal for EXPI, equal for EXPB,  
input5.txt - while, equal, toplama
input6.txt - for, not, equal, toplama, carpma ve carpmanin toplami

I have added also these into Lexer and Parser:

1. syntax/Keywords interface: DEFVAR was missing, so I added it
2. Missing rules which I have added:
	IDLIST -> IDS 
	IDS -> IDS Id | Id
3. In Control Statements I have changed EXPLISTI to EXPI
4. EXPI -> (for (Id EXPI EXPI) EXPLISTI) this is wrong, the right is
   EXPI -> (for (Id EXBI EXPI) EXPLISTI)
// Example: for(int i=0; i<10; ++i)
		EXPI	 EXPB   EXPI
